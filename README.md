# MiniLang — A Custom Programming Language Interpreter

MiniLang is a lightweight, educational programming language implemented in Python using **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)**.  
The project demonstrates the core concepts of **compiler design**, including lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation.

This repository contains a fully working **interpreter front-end** that can tokenize, parse, and execute a small imperative language with variables, expressions, control flow, and functions.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── lexer.py      # Lexical analyzer (tokenizer)
├── parser.py     # Grammar rules and interpreter logic
├── parsetab.py   # Auto-generated PLY parsing table
└── README.md     # Project documentation
```

---

## Features

- Lexical analysis using regular expressions
- Syntax parsing using context-free grammar rules
- Arithmetic and relational expressions
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Looping constructs (`while`)
- Function definitions and function calls
- Return statements
- Block-based scoping using braces `{ }`
- Interactive REPL-style execution
- Graceful syntax and lexical error handling

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)

---

## Language Overview

MiniLang is inspired by C/Python-like syntax and supports:

```text
- Variables and expressions
- Control flow (if-else, while)
- User-defined functions
- Print/output statements
```

Example snippet (illustrative):

```text
def add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

x = add(3, 4);
print(x);
```

## How It Works

1. **lexer.py**
   - Converts source code into a stream of tokens.
   - Identifies keywords, operators, identifiers, literals, and delimiters.

2. **parser.py**
   - Defines grammar rules using PLY’s yacc module.
   - Parses tokens into valid language constructs.
   - Executes statements directly during parsing (interpreter-style).

3. **parsetab.py**
   - Automatically generated by PLY.
   - Stores parsing tables for faster execution.
   - Should not be modified manually.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PLY library

Install PLY:
```bash
pip install ply
```

### Run the Interpreter

```bash
python parser.py
```

You can then start entering MiniLang code interactively.

## Educational Value

This project is ideal for:

- Understanding compiler and interpreter fundamentals
- Learning lexical analysis and parsing
- Academic coursework in Compiler Design / Programming Languages
- Demonstrating language tooling skills in Automata Formal Languages and Logic

---

## Limitations

- No abstract syntax tree (AST) generation
- No static type checking
- Limited standard library
- Designed for learning, not production use

---

## Future Improvements

- Build an AST instead of direct execution
- Add symbol tables with proper scope management
- Introduce type checking
- Support file-based execution
- Improve error diagnostics
- Add more language constructs
